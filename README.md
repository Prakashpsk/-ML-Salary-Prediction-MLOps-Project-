# 💼 CareerBoost: Empowering Employment Equity with ML Salary Prediction

![](https://github.com/Prakashpsk/-ML-Salary-Prediction-MLOps-Project-/blob/main/salarypicture.jpeg)

📊 In this project, we aim to build and deploy a machine learning model for salary prediction using the Adult Salary Prediction dataset from the 1994 US Census. The goal is to predict whether a person earns over $50K a year (Class 1) or less than $50K a year (Class 0). We will utilize AWS SageMaker for model building and deployment, creating a Serverless Inference Endpoint.

## Skills/Concepts Developed
🔍 - Data preprocessing
🛠️ - Model training and evaluation
🎯 - Hyperparameter tuning
☁️ - Deployment using AWS SageMaker

## Problem Statement
🎓 Given demographic and employment-related features, predict whether an individual's salary exceeds $50K annually.

## Impact of Your Work
💡 The deployed model can assist in making informed decisions related to hiring, salary negotiations, and resource allocation, thereby contributing to more equitable employment practices.

## Modeling
### Steps
1. Data preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
2. Model selection: Experiment with various algorithms and select the most suitable one based on performance metrics.
3. Hyperparameter tuning: Optimize model parameters to improve predictive accuracy.
4. Model evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

## Visualization
📈 Visualizations will be generated to illustrate the distribution of features, model performance metrics, and decision boundaries.

## Conclusion
👍 By leveraging machine learning techniques, we have developed a predictive model capable of determining whether an individual earns above or below $50K annually with high accuracy. The deployment of this model as a Serverless Inference Endpoint allows for real-time predictions, enabling seamless integration into existing systems.

## Recommendations
🔄 1. Continuously monitor and update the model to adapt to changing trends and patterns in the data.
🔍 2. Collect additional features or data sources to enhance the predictive power of the model.
📝 3. Conduct regular audits to ensure fairness and mitigate biases in model predictions.

## How to Use
🚀 To utilize the deployed model for salary prediction, send a JSON payload containing relevant features to the deployed endpoint. The model will return the predicted class (0 or 1) indicating the salary category.
